					<time>Dec 24, 2025</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>As a RISC-V enthusiast who works with Kubernetes professionally, I wanted to explore the current state of Kubernetes support for the RISC-V architecture.
Previously, I experimented with a <a href="https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/k3s">fork of k3s</a> built for RISC-V. The experience was successful—I managed to run pods for applications with RISC-V-compatible versions. However, since the build wasn’t officially maintained, I held off on deploying it in my homelab.
A few days ago, I noticed that <a href="https://www.kubesolo.io/">the Kubesolo project</a> now offers <a href="https://github.com/portainer/kubesolo/releases/download/v1.0.0/kubesolo-v1.0.0-linux-riscv64.tar.gz">binaries for RISC-V</a>. Excited, I decided to test it on my Milk-V Mars CM Lite, which currently runs <a href="https://archriscv.felixc.at/">Arch Linux RISC-V</a>.</p>&hellip;

	Since the first time I learned about the existence of RISC-V, I have been fascinated by it. I wanted to run operating systems on it, and try out software on the ISA.

	In this guide I will be explaining how I flash an ESP8266 chip using a Raspberry Pi. More specifically; a Raspberry Pi 2. But any model with GPIO pins will do. In this guide I will be flashing MicroPython on the chip.

					<br><div class="description">
	
	One of the last aspects I wanted to explore and get working on my MangoPi MQ-Pro, is GPIO. For this experiment, like my previous endeavor trying out Bluetooth on my MangoPi MQ-Pro, I used the Ubuntu 22.10 RISC-V image for the SiPeed LicheeRV Dock image.

					<br><div class="description">
	
	I received my MangoPi MQ-Pro a few months ago, and was very eager to test out all the hardware which I use the most on SBC&#39;s. Bluetooth is not one of the features I use a lot on SBC&#39;s. But after having tested out a lot of operating systems and hardware features of the board, I decided to also try and see what the status of Bluetooth on the board was.

					<time>Oct 31, 2022</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	As of writing this article, there are a few choices of operating systems to choose from for the Allwinner D1. In the future, more choices will probably become available. In this article we will take a closer look into FreeBSD and xv6 for the Allwinner D1. I will use a MangoPi MQ-Pro to test these operating systems.

	In this post I will give an overview on how a ran some software compiled for x86_64 on my RISC-V SBC, a MangoPi MQ-Pro. We will be using an awesome piece of software called Box64.

					<time>Aug 28, 2022</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	As the title says, this article will be about using a Raspberry Pi SBC (whatever model), instead of a USB Console Cable to debug another SBC, router, microcontroller... The need for this came when I received my MangoPi MQ-Pro, I wanted to try different operating systems for this SBC, but I didn&#39;t have access to a USB Console Cable, at least not one that was 3.3V tolerant. I wanted to have access to the serial console because a lot of OS images for the MangoPi, at the time of writing this article, didn&#39;t have HDMI drivers. I have already used a Raspberry Pi to flash and interact with micropython on an ESP8266, so I thought, why not use the same method to interact with my new MangoPi.

	For my blog I&#39;m using Github pages to host the static content generated by Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator which creates web pages from markdown files you write. That way, when you don&#39;t want to be bothered with styling your blog, you can just choose a theme from a vast collection, and you&#39;re done. Just write some posts in markdown run the hugo command, and you will find all the static content in the public directory, ready to deploy to a web server, or, in my case, Github pages.
