					<span class="description">
						
						One of the last aspects I wanted to explore and get working on my MangoPi MQ-Pro. For this experiment, like my previous endeavor trying out Bluetooth on my MangoPi MQ-Pro, I used the Ubuntu 22.10 RISC-V image for the SiPeed LicheeRV Dock image.
No extra configuration is needed to get GPIO working with this image on the MangoPi MQ-Pro. I tried out three different ways of accessing the GPIO pins; using legacy sysfs-based access, using the userspace GPIO driver, and lastly using lgpio from Python.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						I received my MangoPi MQ-Pro a few months ago, and was very eager to test out all the hardware which I use the most on SBC&rsquo;s. Bluetooth is not one of the features I use a lot on SBC&rsquo;s. But after having tested out a lot of operating systems and hardware features of the board, I decided to also try and see what the status of Bluetooth on the board was.&hellip;

					<a class="title" href="/posts/exploring-non-linux-oses-on-d1/">Exploring non-Linux Based Operating Systems on Allwinner D1</a> &mdash;
					<span class="description">
						
						Introduction As of writing this article, there are a few choices of operating systems to choose from for the Allwinner D1. In the future, more choices will probably become available. In this article we will take a closer look into FreeBSD and xv6 for the Allwinner D1. I will use a MangoPi MQ-Pro to test these operating systems.
FreeBSD For many people, FreeBSD won&rsquo;t need an introduction. FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system first released in 1993.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						In this post I will give an overview on how a ran some software compiled for x86_64 on my RISC-V SBC, a MangoPi MQ-Pro. We will be using an awesome piece of software called Box64. Basically this software runs x86_64 binaries through an emulator, but with a twist; it uses the native versions of some &ldquo;system&rdquo; libraries, like libc, libm, SDL, and OpenGL, like described in the README of the project:&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						As the title says, this article will be about using a Raspberry Pi SBC (whatever model), instead of a USB Console Cable to debug another SBC, router, microcontroller&hellip; The need for this came when I received my MangoPi MQ-Pro, I wanted to try different operating systems for this SBC, but I didn&rsquo;t have access to a USB Console Cable, at least not one that was 3.3V tolerant. I wanted to have access to the serial console because a lot of OS images for the MangoPi, at the time of writing this article, didn&rsquo;t have HDMI drivers.&hellip;

						The first question you might ask yourself when reading the title of this article is; why would you want to this. My answer to that question is, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?
I like using technology in ways that makes my live easier. That&rsquo;s why I bought my Motorola Moto 360 in the first place, more than five years ago. It has indeed made my life easier in a few ways, quickly reading a message, discarding when necessary, or pulling out my phone when I need/want to reply.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						For my blog I&rsquo;m using Github pages to host the static content generated by Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator which creates web pages from markdown files you write. That way, when you don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with styling your blog, you can just choose a theme from a vast collection, and you&rsquo;re done. Just write some posts in markdown run the hugo command, and you will find all the static content in the public directory, ready to deploy to a web server, or, in my case, Github pages.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						Hello there, this is my first blog post. Let me first start by saying a few words about myself, my name is Bram Oosterlynck and I was born in Belgium. In my free time I like to do a lot of stuff, camping, hiking, road trips, etc. But this blog will be about something else I love doing in my free time. I love playing around with technology, and that is what this blog will be about.&hellip;
