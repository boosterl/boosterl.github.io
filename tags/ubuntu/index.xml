      <description>One of the last aspects I wanted to explore and get working on my MangoPi MQ-Pro. For this experiment, like my previous endeavor trying out Bluetooth on my MangoPi MQ-Pro, I used the Ubuntu 22.10 RISC-V image for the SiPeed LicheeRV Dock image.
No extra configuration is needed to get GPIO working with this image on the MangoPi MQ-Pro. I tried out three different ways of accessing the GPIO pins; using legacy sysfs-based access, using the userspace GPIO driver, and lastly using lgpio from Python.</description>

      <description>I received my MangoPi MQ-Pro a few months ago, and was very eager to test out all the hardware which I use the most on SBC&amp;rsquo;s. Bluetooth is not one of the features I use a lot on SBC&amp;rsquo;s. But after having tested out a lot of operating systems and hardware features of the board, I decided to also try and see what the status of Bluetooth on the board was.</description>
