      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first question you might ask yourself when reading the title of this article is; why would you want to this. My answer to that question is, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like using technology in ways that makes my live easier. That&amp;rsquo;s why I bought my Motorola Moto 360 in the first place, more than five years ago. It has indeed made my life easier in a few ways, quickly reading a message, discarding when necessary, or pulling out my phone when I need/want to reply. Also controlling my music, checking of a shopping list in the supermarket, even making a quick calculation with the built-in calculator. All these things made me really like my smartwacth. I could live without it more easily than my phone, but still, I wear it almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
