      <description>Introduction As of writing this article, there are a few choices of operating systems to choose from for the Allwinner D1. In the future, more choices will probably become available. In this article we will take a closer look into FreeBSD and xv6 for the Allwinner D1. I will use a MangoPi MQ-Pro to test these operating systems.
FreeBSD For many people, FreeBSD won&amp;rsquo;t need an introduction. FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system first released in 1993.</description>

      <description>In this post I will give an overview on how a ran some software compiled for x86_64 on my RISC-V SBC, a MangoPi MQ-Pro. We will be using an awesome piece of software called Box64. Basically this software runs x86_64 binaries through an emulator, but with a twist; it uses the native versions of some &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; libraries, like libc, libm, SDL, and OpenGL, like described in the README of the project:</description>

      <description>As the title says, this article will be about using a Raspberry Pi SBC (whatever model), instead of a USB Console Cable to debug another SBC, router, microcontroller&amp;hellip; The need for this came when I received my MangoPi MQ-Pro, I wanted to try different operating systems for this SBC, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have access to a USB Console Cable, at least not one that was 3.3V tolerant. I wanted to have access to the serial console because a lot of OS images for the MangoPi, at the time of writing this article, didn&amp;rsquo;t have HDMI drivers.</description>
