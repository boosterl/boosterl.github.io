      <description>The first question you might ask yourself when reading the title of this article is; why would you want to this. My answer to that question is, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?
I like using technology in ways that makes my live easier. That&amp;rsquo;s why I bought my Motorola Moto 360 in the first place, more than five years ago. It has indeed made my life easier in a few ways, quickly reading a message, discarding when necessary, or pulling out my phone when I need/want to reply.</description>

      <description>For my blog I&amp;rsquo;m using Github pages to host the static content generated by Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator which creates web pages from markdown files you write. That way, when you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be bothered with styling your blog, you can just choose a theme from a vast collection, and you&amp;rsquo;re done. Just write some posts in markdown run the hugo command, and you will find all the static content in the public directory, ready to deploy to a web server, or, in my case, Github pages.</description>

      <description>Hello there, this is my first blog post. Let me first start by saying a few words about myself, my name is Bram Oosterlynck and I was born in Belgium. In my free time I like to do a lot of stuff, camping, hiking, road trips, etc. But this blog will be about something else I love doing in my free time. I love playing around with technology, and that is what this blog will be about.</description>
